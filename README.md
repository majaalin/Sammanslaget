# Campaign site for Svenska Turistf√∂reningen

![Image description](readme.jpg)

This is a website showing our campaign idea that was created during Yrgo's competition Sammanslaget. We had 76 hours to come up with a campaign idea and execute it. My job was to code a website where we could show information about the campaign.
